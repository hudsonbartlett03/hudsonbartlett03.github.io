<h1>photoshopping and photography</h1>

<p>
For my first project I chose to learn how to take photos and to edit them in adobe photoshop. i completed 7 photos and made them look more artistic.
i took photos for 2 lessons and ended up with close to 200 photos of me and some friendsplaying basketball some good, and some bad. the three main things to worry about when taking photos are
aperture, shutter speed and iso. aperture is the size of the opening of light that comes through, shutter speed is the speed that it does this and iso
measures the sensitivity of the image, the lower the number the less sensitivity, therefore the finer the grain. in the photoshop part of the process 
the aim was to make some of the photos more colourful and vibrant. this process was fairly easy, all it involved was turning up the brightness and maybe
putting a filter on it. once i got to the making certain parts of the photos visible and colourful is when it got a bit tricky. for this i had to use a
magic wand tool and exposure controls. i even used a different sky for photo number 1. for this i had to specifically highlight the areas i wanted gone
and choose a photo from the internet and edit it to make the sky look bluer. h2o gang 4 lyfe xx.
